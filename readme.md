# FastKart

1. FastKart features a front-end only experience with the help of only HTML, CSS and BOOTStrap for Components such as carousels.
2. All the carousel were made by bootstrap.
3. The carousel shown in the demo project was not easy one for CSS & bootstrap only project hence which was made with vue.js.
4. All Categories menu button was made only using css and the fundament of hover.
5. In order to browse the product from the carousel, first of last product have a button to navigate them.
6. I made the whole project as per 1233px min width as I was on a laptop. On demand the project can be converted to 1533px one just by changing few line in css.
6. If SCSS were used, the css code and html code would have been look way to clean.
7. Although, the project was done in HTML only situation. I am also well skilled in next.js and react.js. the same project would have taken way less time if made with react.js with few api's.
